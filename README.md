# PlanningBot

Hi there! Welcome to my PlanningBot. This bot is still under lots of work. Please feel free to contact me at ericleowyuquan@gmail.com if you have any suggestions or would like to contribute.

Let's consider the following scenarios:

A. You are an orientation group leader and have a limited number of rooms available to accommodate many events happening at different times of the day. Each event has varying duration. You wish to find the best allocation possible such that you can maximize the total number of events that are carried out without any clashes.

B. You have a limited number of books / awards / tutors / vouchers / food / drinks / mentors (anything that is in high demand) and many people who have indicated their respective preferences. You wish to find the best way to allocate these scarce resources across people such that everyone gets something within their preferences, while simultaneously avoiding the case where a certain item is being over-allocated (to avoid burnout of tutors and mentors, a certain book may be in limited supply etc.)

C. You are a student and planning your timetable for the next 4 years to clear all the modules required for your degree. However, some modules are pre-requisites of others, while others may only be offered in a certain semester / year. You are also not allowed to clear a module that is a pre-requisite of another in the same semester. Given these restrictions, you would like to find an optimal way for you to structure your timetable such that there are no clashes, and you are able to clear all the modules rquired by the end of 4 years.

D. You are late for work and would like to find the fastest way to get to your office, given the traffic light conditions along the way. You also know the duration in which each traffic light remains red / green. You would like to know the roads you should take to get to your office given a certain time when you leave your house.

Some of these problems above are far too tedious and prone to error if simulated by hand in an attempt to find the most optimal solution. But fret not, leave it to PlanningBot! If you face any variant of the above scenarios in your life, you may want to consider running this bot to put those worries to rest! We will do the work for you.
